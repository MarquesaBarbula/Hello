Hi there! My name is Mariana Barnola and I'm an Old School Art Director, becoming a coder.

Let me tell you a bit about me:

I am in love with art, animals and nature. I love the colors, the letters, the old toys, the books and the old Caribbean music with some notes of Stoner Rock.

I have drawn, cut, glued, painted and sewn since I was a child, hobbies that led me to study Commercial Art & Desktop Publishing in the early 1990s: the last stronghold of traditional graphic design of the 20th century and the early stage of digital graphic design of the 21st century; tradition with novelty, LetrasetÂ® and Adobe Illustrator 3.5Â®.

I have worked as a freelance graphic designer and art director in advertising agencies since my graduation in 1994. I have tried to play a wide range of "suits" within the world of design and graphic arts to train as a complete professional, with great experience and without fear of taking on new challenges in the medium, technology or technique that is necessary to obtain the desired result. In this website you can take a look at my portfolio: https://marianabarnola.rocksfrommars.net/


I am restless, methodical and very organized; Self-taught in many things and therefore a faithful believer in continuous learning, I am always learning something: I am currently studying Front-End engineer at CodeCademy. Soon I'll be sharing some of my code here.

Given my passion for crafts and the impossibility of "doing nothing", I have also created a line of jewelery in natural stones, original and very elegant (in my opinion) called Rocks from Mars. Visit it, https://rocksfrommars.net/ you may like it! ;-) 

And to say goodbye, I must confess that I do not think I could be happy in a world without dogs, music or cheese. When I have free time I like to play the ukulele, read, preserve fruits from the garden, take care of my plants or play with my dogs.

Thank you for visiting me.

Maaz-9
