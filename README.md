My name is Mariana Barnola and I'm an Old School Art director that knows how to code.

Let me tell you a bit about me:

I am in love with art, animals and nature. I love the colors, the letters, the old toys, the books and the old Caribbean music with some notes of Stoner Rock.

I have drawn, cut, glued, painted and sewn since I was a child, hobbies that led me to study Commercial Art & Desktop Publishing in the early 1990s: the last stronghold of traditional graphic design of the 20th century and the early stage of digital graphic design of the 21st century; tradition with novelty, LetrasetÂ® and Adobe Illustrator 3.5Â®.

I've worked as a freelance graphic designer and art director in advertising agencies since my graduation in 1994 trying to play a wide range of "suits" within the world of design and graphic arts to train as a complete professional and without fear of taking on new challenges in any medium, technology or technique necessary to obtain the desired result, even if I don't know it. Take a look at my portfolio! https://marianabarnola.com/


I'm restless, methodical and very organized; Self-taught in many things and therefore a faithful believer in continuous learning, I'm always learning something: recently finished Front-End Engineer at CodeCademy.

Given my passion for crafts and the impossibility of "sitting and doing nothing at all", I've also created a line of jewelery in natural stones, original and very elegant (in my opinion) called Rocks from Mars. Visit it, https://rocksfrommars.net/ you may like it! ;-) 

And to say goodbye, I must confess that I don't think I'd be happy in a world without dogs, music or cheese.
When I have free time I like to play the ukulele, read, preserve fruits from the garden, take care of my plants or play with my dogs.

Thank you for visiting.
